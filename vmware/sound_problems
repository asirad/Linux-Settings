Problem description:
I had a sound problems with VMWare Workstation on Windows 7 and Ubuntu 10.04 as Quest.
Problem appears on linux booting. VMWare reports problem that used device is not reachable.
Manual connection from botton bar doesn't not help me.

Solution:
Go to System->Preference->Sound
Open Hardware tab
Change "Analog Stereo Duplex" to "Analog Stereo Output"

Addition steps:
Press Connect sound from VMWare botton bar and go listen something :)
