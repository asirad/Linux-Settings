Problem description:
How to create custom task to run several others?

Solution:
namespace :spec do
    task :first do
        puts "Do something like first"
    end

    task :second do
        puts "Do something like second"
    end

    task :third do
        puts "Do something like third"
    end
end

task :all => [
    'spec:first',
    'spec:second',
    'spec:third' ]

To run all three tasks one command is needed: rake all
