Problem description:
git commit -m "message" does not allow to write multiline messages

Solution:
I created additional script to have this abiliti e.g.
touch /usr/local/bin/gitci
gedit /usr/local/bin/gitci
add this code:
----- #!/bin/bash
----- message=$1
----- git commit -m"$(echo -e "$message")"
save and use it like that
----- gitci "first line \n second line \n third line"
